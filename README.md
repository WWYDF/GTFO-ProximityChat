# Proximity Chat for GTFO
This differs from my previous mod [PositionalAudio *(aka OpenPA)*](https://github.com/WWYDF/OpenPA) because unlike that mod, this doesn't rely on any software. Simply download the mod, and use the voice chat that's already built into the game!

The goal is to have it be fully client side, with the ability to wake sleepers being host-only.


## Development Cycle

Currently it's in very very early alpha. I just got the core functions operational and it still has a lot of work to do. Once I fix most of the major crashes (like returning to the lobby lol), I will start upload Beta versions on Thunderstore. After 1.0 is released, development builds will only be available on GitHub.

Checkpoints and Dev Builds can currently be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/WWYDF/GTFO-ProximityChat/releases).


## Planned Features

Just a list of what I intend to add before 1.0.
- WakeSleepers *(Previously TalkState)*
	- Speaking near sleepers can cause them to wake up.
- Hard Mode
	- Speaking near sleepers will cause them to instantly wake up.
	- (Get Noise Suppression/Gate for mechanical keyboards monkaS)
- Audio Filters?
	- Lowpass when in another room?
	- Highpass when in gas?


## Known Issues

- [ ] Crash when exiting expedition.

(I haven't done a lot of testing)
